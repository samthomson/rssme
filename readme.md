## RSSme

[![travis ci](https://travis-ci.org/samthomson/rssme.svg "travis ci")](https://travis-ci.org/samthomson/rssme)

standalone php/mysql rss client (webbased) built on laravel 5

built to be a minimal rss client, similar to googles old reader and without limits (run on your own hardware).

lots of features planned, but taking as much of a 'less is more' approach.
